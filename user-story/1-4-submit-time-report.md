# 1.4 Submit Time Report 

```
As an employee,
I want to submit my time sheet.
```
## Use Cases
### Primary Flow
```
Given a url with the time report id
   https://tymish.com/submit-time-report/66096e79-91de-48e5-a8b3-7652845c6ae1

when an employee navigates to the url in a browser
   the system loads the time report for the employee.

Then, when the employee submits their time entries for the month,
   the system saves their time report
   and notifies the employee that their time report has been submitted.
```
